Today I got quite bit done. I reduced the whitespace between items in
the grid view on the beta site, I wrote and exposed an edit form for the
category headers, and I figured out but have not yet implemented the
fancy calendar at `people.rit.edu/fls5835`_. The main problem with that
last one is that the calendar is built and pulled in by Javascript, and
changing it to fit in a different space will be some trouble.
