As you may notice, my blog looks a lot different now. On the recommendation of a few FOSSBoxers, I have moved to `Pelican`_, a Python-based static site generator. The practical upshot of which is that I can now write posts in `reStructuredText`_, keep the posts themsevles in git, and host the whole thing on `GitHub Pages`_.

While all of my posts have been successfully moved, not every one has survived intact. in particular, paragraph splits in a number of older blogs have been lost. I will try to rectify those as they crop up, but there's a lot to go through.

One of the casualties of the move was the comments. Pelican does not handle comments on its own, and while I can hook up a specialized service like Disqus, I've decided that it isn't worth the effort at present.
