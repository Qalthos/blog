Today was the day we got `Rebecca`_ on to a git repo towards
implementing her changes to the people dashboard. It's only a halfway
step, as she isn't entirely using the proper version of the widgets but
a hacked one that works locally, and needs to be morphed into something
that will work in the context of the CIVX stack. Hopefully soon she will
be up to speed and be able to make a more direct submission in the near
future.
As it stands, this is good stuff, and the end result is definitely
usable, even if it's not in the format we want it just yet. Translating
one to the other has proven tiresome as well; I spent the better part of
three hours just to clean up the first of our tabs. There are a few
items I think might not be translatable, things that mainly live in
Moksha, but we'll get to that when we get to that. Right now, I need a
graphical diff viewer that cares neither for whitespace nor line breaks,
just for what's in the code. Good old meld, which I had been using, has
proven itself inadequate to the massive differences between these files.
Hopefully tomorrow I will have a fresh start from which to sculpt this
mess I've constructed into its completed form.
