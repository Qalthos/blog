One of the cool features of CIVX that really caught my interest when I
first started working on it was the `Knowledge DB`_. Using the magic of
Python, Knowledge is a vertical, polymorphic databse for storing
knowledge about things, which means very little to anyone, even me.

What Knowledge does is it allows you to store anything (or anything
Python can pickle, at least), as arbitrary collections of Entities and
Facts.
