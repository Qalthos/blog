This is my first posting despite having been here for a week, because
the zaniness that was my first week did not allow for such silly things
as introductions. Now I finally have some of the infrastructure things
worked out, and can report on my findings.

Work has been progressing on a scraper for `shapefiles`_ for the Senate.
I've been fairly successful in getting a large amount of data, (up to
7.6 GB of zip files!) so my task today was to clean up the script and
make it readable to commit it back upstream. I had started by adding
more loops to the script for special cases, but that meant repeating the
core download code. Realizing this, I made a generalized downloader
function which gets called by each loop, simplifying individual loops
into a simple

.. code-block:: bash

    for URL in $URL_LIST; download $URL $FILE; done

Well, I think it's simpler...

Each time I tweak away at this file, my bash skill gets better and
better, but whether any of this is going to stick around is another
question. I always forget the simple bashisms, like for loops and
conditionals, and I can never remember quite how variables work. But as
I work more with this file, I get more comfortable with these
conventions. Though I still occasionally pine for the occasional
pythonic statement (and perhaps also for the fjords).
