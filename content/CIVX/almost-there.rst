Today I worked my way through more of `Rebecca's`_ changes to the people
dashboard. It was actually in better condition than I had thought last
night. The first tab whas the only one with the majority of the changes,
and most of the changes were easily applied once I understood them-
which is what I spent hours yesterday trying to do.
I have a problem with writing quantities of HTML because they end up as
giant messes. Even XHTML strict isn't enough for me, though it does come
closer. Invariably, any file of reasonable complexity is going to have
whitespace inconsistencies, mislaid elements, or even entire sections
forgotten. This morning I took a fresh look at the generated HTML and
dashboard.mak and tried simply to understand their structure. After
really getting into the template version, I began to see what was really
necessary and not from Rebecca's blinged up copy. There are still a few
bits missing from the final version, but I think I can get them nailed
down before I leave today.
