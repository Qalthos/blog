So I've recieved my apparently mandated CIVX nickname, despite it
possibly being inaccurate in a week or two. I, along with `Pixel Ninja`_
and `Python Princess`_, have been hacking away at our various tasks
together for over a week now, and despite the seemingly constant moving
from place to place, it's a pretty sweet gig.
My work yesterday was some final polishing of the getall script, and my
first real push to the geowebdns repository. I'm also workign on a
supplemental, informational guide to maintenance. Unfortunately, my
changes can't quite replace the old script yet, because the import
script (the one that actually starts to bring the files into the
database and do something with them) is hardcoded to the current files
and that script is a bit harder to hack than the download script. The
real work was on the documentation, trying to get people to understand
my reasoning behind the changes and allow for them to continue my work
without too much difficulty.
