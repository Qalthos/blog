So I'm back at RIT for the summer working on CIVX again. There's been a
lot of development on Moksha, the software stack CIVX runs on, and not
all of it was a trivial update. Still, many of the problems I
encountered were definitely my fault, not the least of which was
forgetting Arch Linux has switched to Python 3.

Once I was up, I looked into fixing the people dashboard we worked on
last summer. In the meantime, the NYS Senate updated their API for
getting open government data, so I had to figure out the new scheme and
try to make it work. Complicating this is that they still don't have
easy access to grabbing all the current senators, and the page we look
at to get this information changed enough to stop the script from
completing.

I'm actually surprised how quickly I was able to work this out, though
of course this is not even remotely new to me. But despite nearly a year
of inactivity on the project I seem to have gotten back into the swing
of it pretty well.
