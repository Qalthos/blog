Every time I go through one of these calls I feel like I come out
knowing less about the topic discussed. The topics aren't hard, and I
can now follow along and understand most of what they're talking about,
but most of the technologies are things I haven't really looked at
before. It's interesting, and it's exciting, but it's a little wearying
too. The majority of the talks seem to revolve around the use of Amazon
EC2 instances, of which I know nothing.

On my own tasks, the semifinal versions of the getall script and the
associated documentation got pushed to `geowebdns`_' repository today. I
feel pretty good about the changes I made, even if it doesn't prove
useful to the current task, I have opened up some small part of someone
else's open source program, and that's really cool.
