Here we are, back at the beginning of another school year. It's going to
be interesting, I'm still pretty laid back from Fan Expo Canada in
Toronto.
My new monitor finally arrived. Well, it arrived Saturday, but the RIT
post office isn't open on weekends over breaks, so I had to wait until
this morining. Luckily, it seems that the stand on my last monitor which
made me love it so much is a standard VESA mount, so I detached it from
my old monitor, removed the sad excuse of a stand from my new monitor,
and now have a beautiful new screen on the beautiful old stand. The new
monitor, meanwhile, being an LED-backlit model, is much lighter now than
it's stand. The speakers seem okay, although they're on the back of the
monitor (no doubt meant to reflect off the wall behind them) so if I
want to blast music, I'll just end up blasting Justin instead.
So I now have two monitors, though I don't know if I'm keeping the
ancient 15" LCD from home that was serving as a spare. We'll see. In the
meantime, Minecraft looks better than ever.
