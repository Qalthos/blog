And in mostly unrelated but terribly belated news, I finally released
`pyDex 1.0`_ this morning. Black/White pokedex, new config system, baby
pokemon, and game detection, are all new features introduced in this
version. Old configs should get read properly and get seamlessly updated
to the new version, though there may be a few bugs in the process.
