I've finally gotten around to staging and commiting a few enhancements
to the `pydex repository`_. The more advanced stuff like Isshu pokemon
and the new file format are still in limbo, naturally, and won't get
moved to master any time soon since they make older files incompatible,
though I hope to at least be able to read them for the time being.
I'm also beginning to wonder about dynamically limiting the National
Pokedex based on the game setting, once that actually does something.
I've only played Gen IV extensively, but after loading up Yellow on a
whim, I see how this could be useful. But I'm more concerned with
bugfixing 1.0 so that it can see the light of daythan tacking on more
features right now.
