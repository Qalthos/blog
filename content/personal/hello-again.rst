I've thought a lot about writing this post.

I've also thought a lot about *not* writing it, and just leaving the whole thing
up as a semipermanent memorial to he-who-never-really-was.

But then I got to fixing up the domain redirects, and then I noticed the content
errors, and got around to fixing rather a lot of things that had piled up in the
last nine years since I'd last updated this and that meant taking some time to
read some of the posts I had made back in the FOSS\@RIT days. And it really
crystalized a few things for me â€” and reinforced the idea that after all that
has changed, I am still me.

So, if you've been here before, please take note of the new name and location,
and welcome back. If you're new here, well, I really don't know what to tell
you. I can't say that I intend to update this ever again, but at least I will
feel at home if I do.
