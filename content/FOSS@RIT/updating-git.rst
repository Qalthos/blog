We here at RIT are working on our own branch of Ductus, and Ductus got a
big addition over the weekend, namespaces. Unfortunately, our repository
didn't know anything about that and needed to be updated.
Now, I'm not a novice to using git, nor are any of the people in the
FOSSBOX. But we'd never had to worry about upstream repositories, for
all of our projects, we \*were\* upstream.
Taylor and I finally worked it out\*, and now we're trying to fix all
the problems that came up with the new hotness as best as we can. but
even when you feel comfortable with something, you can never quite
escape the possibility that something you hadn't considered might show
up.
\* The process, for reference, as near as I can figure
git remote add
git pull
git push
