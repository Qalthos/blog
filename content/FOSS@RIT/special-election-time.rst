Rochester is having a special election tomorrow to choose a new Mayor,
as the previous Mayor, Robert Duffy, is now the Lieutenant Governor of
New York. I've been following the race with some interest despite not
being registered to vote in this area, especially since I know one of
the candidates.
But more exciting than the actual business of an politics is the
election itself, which gives a great opportunity to introduce `Election
Scraper 2.0`_.
You may remeber the old version. It was largely untested, had a few
design issues, and wasn't very pretty to look at. Through the election
night, I tweaked and honed it, until finally, mere minutes before the
close of the last poll, it gave a very close approximation to an
accurate number.
We probably won't have that many problems this time around. But who
knows? I'm looking forward to an exciting night in any case, and I'll be
ready to fix any problems as they come.
