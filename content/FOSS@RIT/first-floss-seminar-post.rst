So this quarter I am taking a `FLOSS`_ Seminar being taught by `Bean`_
which should be pretty awesome. As a graduate student (as well as a
fairly advanced FLOSS citizen) there are a few extra things going to be
required of me, and we're working on ironing out the exact details now.
It looks like it's going to be a really cool quarter.
