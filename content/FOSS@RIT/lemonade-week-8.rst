So... lots of stuff has happened in the last few weeks.
First, we have a new background, thanks to JT. In fact, we have three
now, and as of five minutes ago, a different one will show up depending
on the current weather.
There's also been a lot of behind-the-scenes updates to make adding new
events and weather types easier in the future. Generally, all that kind
of stuff goes in constants.py, but that might have to change if we need
to add too much more stuff.
We've got a few exciting ideas we hope to get done in the next few
weeks, and I look forward to seeing what we can get done.
