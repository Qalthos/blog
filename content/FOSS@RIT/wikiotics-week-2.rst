We're into week 2 of Wikiotics' `four week plan`_ to push Wikiotics
development, so I thought I'd get out all the stuff I did last week.
First, in order to get myself acquainted with the user interface I
translated (badly) the introduction lesson into `Russian`_ (and later
tapped `Ellen Rocket's`_ German prowess for a `German`_ one).
Later I was asked to look into creoleparser to see if I could fix `bug
42`_ to disable external image loading, which we also want for Ductus.
Getting into yet another python codebase so soon was interesting,
especially when I had to switch back and forth looking at things
`Taylor`_ was doing.
That's all I really got into for week one, but now that I'm fairly
comfortable with the various technolologies being used, I think things
will really start rolling soon
