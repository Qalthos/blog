This happened quite some time ago now, but with the election coverage I
haven't had much time to get this out.
Two weeks ago, Taylor and I were asked to appear at the opening of the
Constellation Commons for Global Learning, to show off Wikiotics as a
student project and set up Wikiotics on all the computers. We got to
show the site off to President Destler and to a few foreign language
professors who were all quite excited about such a thing existing.
In all we showed off the project to a fair number of people and got a
very positive reaction from most of them. I don't know if we've seen any
more users from this, but it seems to me it should help spread the word
about Wikiotics.
