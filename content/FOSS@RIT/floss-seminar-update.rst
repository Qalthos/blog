So it's week 5, what has been going on?

The class has split into three groups, working on different games. My
group's idea is a social update to the venerable likes of `robocode`_,
though how exactly that is going to pan out is still debatable.

Ideally, this would comprise of a wrapper around the basic game, not
requiring much tweaking of the internals, though a new interface would be
required for use on the web. All in all the class is shaping up to be
pretty interesting.
