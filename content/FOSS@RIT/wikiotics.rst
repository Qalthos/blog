As of Friday, I have been doing some work (along with `Taylor`_ for a
new set of people, `Wikiotics`_. Their goal is basically to create a
FLOSS alternative to some of the commercial translation software out
there, particularly the ever-so-expensive Rosetta Stone. The whole thing
is built on a custom wiki platform called `Ductus`_.
Today, I cloned their development tree for local development, located at
`http://gitorious.org/ductus-rit/`_. Right now, nothing's been done to
it, but this will be the staging area for our work here at RIT (and
anyone who wants to get any additions into our tree) before going off to
the master tree at ductus.us.
We're still figuring out where everyone stands with development. I think
the guys at ductus are pleasantly surprised at how much we already have
under our belts here at the FOSSBOX. But that's just how we roll here at
RIT.
