So `trose`_ and I have been asked to put a bow on the Wikiotics work
while we're between projects. We both hit some bumps at the end of the
quarter, so there's a few unused hours left to put into this project.
One of the things we've been tasked with is looking at the CSS and
seeing if there is anything we can do to it to make it look a little
better. Now, neither trose nor I are designers by any stretch of the
imagination, but we've got a few ideas that might go a ways to making
Wikiotics look more attractive.

This is how Wikiotics looks today. The different actions possible on a
page are hanging out awkwardly in the center, and there's no clear
division between the header and the content. After looking at this for a
while, trose and I decided that we would emulate a few of the more
reasonable designs of the more common wiki systems out there.

This is how Wikiotics looks on our local git. The 'tabs' have been moved
to the right, and pushed further into the top bar (maybe too much).
Further, the active tab bleeds into the content area, which is lightly
colored to mark it as a separate area from the header and footer areas.
The changed text and color on the top bar are not our doing, this
appears to be a side-effect of running a subinstance of another page as
we are, as is the case with the red link color.
These changes are a small step, but I think they go some way towards
making Wikiotics a bit more approachable to outsiders. There are a few
more things to be done on Friday, but I don't think we're yet done
looking at this.
