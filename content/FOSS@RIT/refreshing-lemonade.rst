In other news, todayyesterday marked the `final release of Lemonade
Stand 2.0`_. Now running on the `Fortune Engine`_ and containing 0% of
my code, this marks an important milestone in my open-source
`sugar-based`_ lemonade stand game as it's still getting developed!
While I can claim none of the credit for the code, it is still
satisfying to watch my very first open source project still on its feet,
teetering around like a drunken toddler.
