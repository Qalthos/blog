It looks like Lemonade Stand is taking off for fall quarter's `HFOSS`_
class. This is quite exciting and there's a number of things I'm looking
to get in for a 2.2 release
\* More events
\* Fluctuating prices
\* Loyalty and advertising
among `others`_.
The 2.1 release, meanwhile, I would like to focus on usability and
graphics, as those have been being worked on for the longest so far.
Whether any of this will work out the way I'm imagining is debatable,
but I've got a plan and two `awesome`_ `people`_ working on it with me
