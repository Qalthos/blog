I am proud to announce the immediate availability of Lemonade Stand 2.1,
with a quarter's worth of work and effort behind it.
There are few gameplay changes in this release, but it feels like a
brand new game thanks to the wonderful new art assets courtesy of `JT`_.
There's also the beginning of a help system, and many generalizations in
the code to make adding new features even easier than before.
We're a little late for a midnight release, but for my first real game
release, I don't think we did half bad.
