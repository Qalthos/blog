&lt;p&gt;I've also thought a lot about &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; writing it, and just leaving the whole thingup as a semipermanent memorial to he-who-never-really-was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I got to fixing up the domain redirects, and then I noticed the content
errors, and got around to fixing rather a lot of things that had piled up in the
last nine years since I'd last updated this and that meant taking some time to
read some of the posts I had made back in the FOSS&amp;#64;RIT days. And it really
crystalized a few things for me — and reinforced the idea that after all that
has changed, I am still me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you've been here before, please take note of the new name and location,
and welcome back. If you're new here, well, I really don't know what to tell
you. I can't say that I intend to update this ever again, but at least I will
feel at home if I do.&lt;/p&gt;

called  &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/"&gt;ditaa&lt;/a&gt;. The basic idea is it takes a textual representation of a
diagram, and turns it into a real image. My first thought was that this looked

called  &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/"&gt;ditaa&lt;/a&gt;. The basic idea is it takes a textual representation of a
diagram, and turns it into a real image. My first thought was that this looked
real neat for use in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write this now not in HTML directly, but in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html"&gt;reStructured Text&lt;/a&gt;, a somewhat
less verbose markup language native to Python. Thankfully, someone had already
made a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/dvarrazzo/3807373"&gt;directive&lt;/a&gt; for ditaa diagrams to be embedded in reST and get rendered
to an image in the final page. With this in hand, I managed to cobble together
a plugin for pelican to add that directive to my posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's only one live example at the moment, which is my
&lt;a class="reference external" href="/fossrit/american-greetings-hackathon-followup.html"&gt;American Greetings hackathon&lt;/a&gt; post. The plugin itself has been added to my
fork of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/Qalthos/pelican-plugins"&gt;pelican-plugins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not all great, though. One thing I would really like is the ability to
render the diagram to SVG instead of PNG. SVG is much better for things like
simple diagrams, as it is web-native, (all it is is a special kind of XML
document), and it's vector-based, making it inherently scalable for different
sized displays. As near as I can tell, ditaa appears to use SVG internally, at
least to some extent. Ideally, I'd like to try to re-implement it in Python, not
necessarily for any benefit, but because the problem sounds interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all of my posts have been successfully moved, not every one has survived
intact. in particular, paragraph splits in a number of older blogs have been
lost. I will try to rectify those as they crop up, but there's a lot to go
through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the casualties of the move was the comments. Pelican does not handle
comments on its own, and while I can hook up a specialized service like Disqus,
I've decided that it isn't worth the effort at present.&lt;/p&gt;
