knowing less about the topic discussed. The topics aren't hard, and I
can now follow along and understand most of what they're talking about,
but most of the technologies are things I haven't really looked at
before. It's interesting, and it's exciting, but it's a little wearying
too. The majority of the talks seem to revolve around the use of Amazon
EC2 instances, of which I know nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my own tasks, the semifinal versions of the getall script and the
associated documentation got pushed to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org/slinkp/geowebdns"&gt;geowebdns&lt;/a&gt;' repository today. I
feel pretty good about the changes I made, even if it doesn't prove
useful to the current task, I have opened up some small part of someone
else's open source program, and that's really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work yesterday was some final polishing of the getall script, and my
first real push to the geowebdns repository. I'm also working on a
supplemental, informational guide to maintenance. Unfortunately, my
changes can't quite replace the old script yet, because the import
script (the one that actually starts to bring the files into the
database and do something with them) is hardcoded to the current files
and that script is a bit harder to hack than the download script. The
real work was on the documentation, trying to get people to understand
my reasoning behind the changes and allow for them to continue my work
without too much difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;
