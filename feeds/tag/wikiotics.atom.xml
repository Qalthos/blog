while we're between projects. We both hit some bumps at the end of the
quarter, so there's a few unused hours left to put into this project.
One of the things we've been tasked with is looking at the CSS and
seeing if there is anything we can do to it to make it look a little
better. Now, neither trose nor I are designers by any stretch of the
imagination, but we've got a few ideas that might go a ways to making
Wikiotics look more attractive.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_NuCXZozR8O8/TQAXjymF2KI/AAAAAAAAAi8/02g5WgJiCj0/s320/Screenshot-Wikiotics%2B-%2BNamoroka-1.png"&gt;|image0|&lt;/a&gt;
This is how Wikiotics looks today. The different actions possible on a
page are hanging out awkwardly in the center, and there's no clear
division between the header and the content. After looking at this for a
while, trose and I decided that we would emulate a few of the more
reasonable designs of the more common wiki systems out there.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_NuCXZozR8O8/TQAXkGhFoPI/AAAAAAAAAjE/lnUp7vNtbAI/s320/Screenshot-Wikiotics%2B-%2BNamoroka.png"&gt;|image1|&lt;/a&gt;
This is how Wikiotics looks on our local git. The 'tabs' have been moved
to the right, and pushed further into the top bar (maybe too much).
Further, the active tab bleeds into the content area, which is lightly
colored to mark it as a separate area from the header and footer areas.
The changed text and color on the top bar are not our doing, this
appears to be a side-effect of running a subinstance of another page as
we are, as is the case with the red link color.
These changes are a small step, but I think they go some way towards
making Wikiotics a bit more approachable to outsiders. There are a few
more things to be done on Friday, but I don't think we're yet done
looking at this.&lt;/p&gt;

Two weeks ago, Taylor and I were asked to appear at the opening of the
Constellation Commons for Global Learning, to show off Wikiotics as a
student project and set up Wikiotics on all the computers. We got to
show the site off to President Destler and to a few foreign language
professors who were all quite excited about such a thing existing.
In all we showed off the project to a fair number of people and got a
very positive reaction from most of them. I don't know if we've seen any
more users from this, but it seems to me it should help spread the word
about Wikiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, I'm not a novice to using git, nor are any of the people in the
FOSSBOX. But we'd never had to worry about upstream repositories, for
all of our projects, we *were* upstream.
Taylor and I finally worked it out*, and now we're trying to fix all
the problems that came up with the new hotness as best as we can. but
even when you feel comfortable with something, you can never quite
escape the possibility that something you hadn't considered might show
up.
* The process, for reference, as near as I can figure
git remote add
git pull
git push&lt;/p&gt;

Later I was asked to look into creoleparser to see if I could fix &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/creoleparser/issues/detail?id=42"&gt;bug
42&lt;/a&gt; to disable external image loading, which we also want for Ductus.
Getting into yet another python codebase so soon was interesting,
especially when I had to switch back and forth looking at things
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://trosehfoss.blogspot.com/"&gt;Taylor&lt;/a&gt; was doing.
That's all I really got into for week one, but now that I'm fairly
comfortable with the various technologies being used, I think things
will really start rolling soon&lt;/p&gt;

is built on a custom wiki platform called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://code.ductus.us/"&gt;Ductus&lt;/a&gt;.
Today, I cloned their development tree for local development, located at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://gitorious.org/ductus-rit/"&gt;http://gitorious.org/ductus-rit/&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, nothing's been done to
it, but this will be the staging area for our work here at RIT (and
anyone who wants to get any additions into our tree) before going off to
the master tree at ductus.us.
We're still figuring out where everyone stands with development. I think
the guys at ductus are pleasantly surprised at how much we already have
under our belts here at the FOSSBOX. But that's just how we roll here at
RIT.&lt;/p&gt;
