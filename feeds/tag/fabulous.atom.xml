Let's see what I managed
to get through so far.
One of the things I got to look at this week is threebean's mokshactl
branch of CIVX and Moksha. This is a project to simplify the
administration of a Moksha installation. The project grew out of an
attempt to easily package Moksha and grew into a much larger system
capable of managing most aspects of CIVX at once, and in a very pretty
package, too. It has a few problems, but for the most part, it performs
quite well, and best of all, it will even integrate itself with Moksha,
controlling the necessary aspects of Moksha as well.
In less exciting news, I poked around in the people dashboard while I
had some time and got Assembly members working again. It didn't take
much as I had expected, but served to keep me on task while Remy was in
one of the never ending series of meetings he's had this week.
On a lighter side of things, I put some &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://lobstertech.com/fabulous.html"&gt;fabulous&lt;/a&gt; in the CIVX shell
today as I was working in it. The mokshactl branch is already
fabuloused, and once you see that, there's no coming back. fabulous
makes things very pretty with only a little work.
Other than that not a lot has gone down. Some work has gone into the
polyscraper, but that's nothing worth mentioning at this point. Between
that and some internal matters and hours of meetings and my car
developing a leak in it's brake line, that's all that went down this
week. Tomorrow I get to drive home and hopefully fix my car properly.&lt;/p&gt;
