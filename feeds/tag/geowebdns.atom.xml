knowing less about the topic discussed. The topics aren't hard, and I
can now follow along and understand most of what they're talking about,
but most of the technologies are things I haven't really looked at
before. It's interesting, and it's exciting, but it's a little wearying
too. The majority of the talks seem to revolve around the use of Amazon
EC2 instances, of which I know nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my own tasks, the semifinal versions of the getall script and the
associated documentation got pushed to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org/slinkp/geowebdns"&gt;geowebdns&lt;/a&gt;' repository today. I
feel pretty good about the changes I made, even if it doesn't prove
useful to the current task, I have opened up some small part of someone
else's open source program, and that's really cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My work yesterday was some final polishing of the getall script, and my
first real push to the geowebdns repository. I'm also working on a
supplemental, informational guide to maintenance. Unfortunately, my
changes can't quite replace the old script yet, because the import
script (the one that actually starts to bring the files into the
database and do something with them) is hardcoded to the current files
and that script is a bit harder to hack than the download script. The
real work was on the documentation, trying to get people to understand
my reasoning behind the changes and allow for them to continue my work
without too much difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work has been progressing …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is my first posting despite having been here for a week, because
the zaniness that was my first week did not allow for such silly things
as introductions. Now I finally have some of the infrastructure things
worked out, and can report on my findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work has been progressing on a scraper for &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile"&gt;shapefiles&lt;/a&gt; for the Senate.
I've been fairly successful in getting a large amount of data, (up to
7.6 GB of zip files!) so my task today was to clean up the script and
make it readable to commit it back upstream. I had started by adding
more loops to the script for special cases, but that meant repeating the
core download code. Realizing this, I made a generalized downloader
function which gets called by each loop, simplifying individual loops
into a simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
'for URL in $URL_LIST; download $URL $FILE; done'
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I think it's simpler...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time I tweak away at this file, my bash skill gets better and
better, but whether any of this is going to stick around is another
question. I always forget the simple bashisms, like for loops and
conditionals, and I can never remember quite how variables work. But as
I work more with this file, I get more comfortable with these
conventions. Though I still occasionally pine for the occasional
pythonic statement (and perhaps also for the fjords).&lt;/p&gt;
