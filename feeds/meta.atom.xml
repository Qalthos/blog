On the recommendation of a few FOSSBoxers, I have moved to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a Python-based static site generator. The practical upshot of which is that I can now write posts in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html"&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt;, keep the posts themsevles in git, and host the whole thing on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While all of my posts have been successfully moved, not every one has survived intact. in particular, paragraph splits in a number of older blogs have been lost. I will try to rectify those as they crop up, but there's a lot to go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the casualties of the move was the comments. Pelican does not handle comments on its own, and while I can hook up a specialized service like Disqus, I've decided that it isn't worth the effort at present.&lt;/p&gt;

keep a blog, and to keep it separate from any other blogs we may keep.
The new blog is linked at left, but anything interesting will get
crossposted here and it's likely going to go unmaintained at the
conclusion of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here it is: &lt;a class="reference external" href="other-person.tumblr.com"&gt;other-person.tumblr.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
