christened WebBotWar (or just WebBot) to actually work on the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had it working locally some time last week (I think... the days are
really starting to mush together), but OpenShift was a whole other
thing. This boiled down to two basic problems we had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pybotwar depended on pyBox2D, which needs to compile, which doesn't
work well even when you have control of the machine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We were relying on memcached to provide cheap communication between
the pybotwar process and the frontend. As near as I can tell,
memcached is not actually supported on OpenShift Express, though that
might not actually be true.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was surprisingly easy to fix, though it took me some time to
actually think of the solution. In the final setup, there are
essentially three repositories: our modified pybotwar, the TG2 webbot
frontend, and a meta-repository containing both of the previous two in
the proper places. This third repo is not meant to be actually used to
develop, its only purpose is to be pushed to OpenShift and act as a
quick pull for someone looking to run WebBotWar themselves. The
practical upshot of this is that if we commit pyBox2D inside the
pybotwar directory of our meta-repo, pybotwar can find its dependencies,
and no one else needs to have to bother with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second problem was more tricky, and eventually resulted in a rather
simple patch that just happened to take me around 12 hours to get right.
A quick Google of OpenShift Express Python and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL"&gt;NoSQL&lt;/a&gt; led me to
MongoDB, which has some benefits and drawbacks compared to just shoving
bits into memory, but seems to work very well in practice and is
probably the right way to go regardless. To be perfectly fair, memcached
&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a type of NoSQL, but MongoDB is actually supported by OpenShift in
an easily-installable manner, and despite its more finicky syntax, it
works, which is something I failed to get with memcached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the rest of my team was hard at work making massive progress
on other fronts. Facebook authentication works, as does uploading custom
robot definitions, though I don't think the two are plugged into each
other yet. As well, there are brand new pretty images for the robots and
the turrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a few outstanding problems left, but (as long as I don't push
anything broken) you can have a look at webbotwar in action &lt;a class="reference external" href="webbotwar-qalthos.rhcloud.com"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The class has split into three groups, working on different games. My
group's idea is a social update to the venerable likes of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://robocode.sourceforge.net/"&gt;robocode&lt;/a&gt;,
though how exactly that is going to pan out is still debatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, this would comprise of a wrapper around the basic game, not
requring much tweaking of the internals, though a new interface would be
required for use on the web. All in all the class is shaping up to be
pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

which should be pretty awesome. As a graduate student (as well as a
fairly advanced FLOSS citizen) there are a few extra things going to be
required of me, and we're working on ironing out the exact details now.
It looks like it's going to be a really cool quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

with a quarter's worth of work and effort behind it.
There are few gameplay changes in this release, but it feels like a
brand new game thanks to the wonderful new art assets courtesy of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jtmengel.blogspot.com/"&gt;JT&lt;/a&gt;.
There's also the beginning of a help system, and many generalizations in
the code to make adding new features even easier than before.
We're a little late for a midnight release, but for my first real game
release, I don't think we did half bad.

Have we accomplished our
goals? I think so.
We've gotten a lot done in the last ten weeks. We got some new images,
we got some new ideas into the game, and on the whole, it looks much
better. The game is slowly taking shape into something people might
actually want to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let's compare what we've actually done to our goals. The first goal
was to get an updated background image with prettier graphics that
changed with the weather. This is definitely done, and has been for a
week or two. We've since invented a few more graphics that need to be
included in the main screen, but the placeholders we have should do for
now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we wanted to get a graphical store in place and working. That's
almost done, and should be finished before the end of the week. The
store is fully functional, it just needs a few tweaks and some feedback
on the user's current inventory. For the time being that can be fixed
until we can get a more permanent solution later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the overlooked problem we were ignoring this whole time, an in
game help system. This is moving along, not well, but it should be
functional by our release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="lemonade"></category><category term="FOSSRIT"></category></entry><entry><title>Lemonade Week... 8?</title><link href="http://blog.linkybook.com/lemonade-week-8.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2010-10-26T23:59:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Nathaniel Case</name></author><id>tag:blog.linkybook.com,2010-10-26:lemonade-week-8.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So... lots of stuff has happened in the last few weeks.
First, we have a new background, thanks to JT. In fact, we have three
now, and as of five minutes ago, a different one will show up depending
on the current weather.
There's also been a lot of behind-the-scenes updates to make adding new
events and weather types easier in the future. Generally, all that kind
of stuff goes in constants.py, but that might have to change if we need
to add too much more stuff.
We've got a few exciting ideas we hope to get done in the next few
weeks, and I look forward to seeing what we can get done.&lt;/p&gt;

class. This is quite exciting and there's a number of things I'm looking
to get in for a 2.2 release
* More events
* Fluctuating prices
* Loyalty and advertising
among &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Lemonade_Stand#Additional_Ideas_.26_Features"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;.
The 2.1 release, meanwhile, I would like to focus on usability and
graphics, as those have been being worked on for the longest so far.
Whether any of this will work out the way I'm imagining is debatable,
but I've got a plan and two &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://smw-os.blogspot.com/"&gt;awesome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jtmengel.blogspot.com"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; working on it with me&lt;/p&gt;

keep a blog, and to keep it separate from any other blogs we may keep.
The new blog is linked at left, but anything interesting will get

conclusion of the quarter.
